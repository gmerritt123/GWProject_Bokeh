# Well Capture Application

![WellCaptureGif](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbdfef11-442b-438c-b38a-655a1102a5f4)

This application illustrates the steady state capture zone of a fully penetrating pumping well drawing from a perfectly confined, homogenous and isotropic aquifer of uniform thickness and infinite extent under a uniform regional gradient. The head solution was derived using basic analytic elements with help from Professor James Craig at the University of Waterloo (https://www.civil.uwaterloo.ca/jrcraig/ ).

5 Sliders control the key controlling parameters: pumping rate, aquifer thickness, regional gradient, hydraulic conductivity, and porosity.

A Button toggle located below the sliders toggles between viewing contours in terms of absolute hydraulic head and drawdown due to pumping.

The plan view plot illustrates:

- The pumping well at 0,0
- Hydraulic Head/Drawdown contours
- The well's capture zone under the current combination of parameters, with the maximum width and culmination point (x0) annotated
- **Particle Tracking** : click anywhere within the plot area to release a hypothetical particle and view its destination (i.e. the pumping well or not), as well as its associated travel time.
